1.
The null hypothesis for TV is that given radio and newspaper then TV has no effect.  Do this same mix with the other variables.  Based on these results it is likely that when running TV and radio adds that running newspaper ads has no effect.

2.
A KNN classifier and KNN regression both take a set of k unique nearest entities.  KNN classifier then decides the class based on some sort of method (e.g. taking the class with the most instances).  KNN regressions then decides on a number based on some sort of method (e.g. taking an average of the set).

iii.  X_3 is 1 if Female.  The coefficent B_3 is 35.  That means holding everything else contast you get a 35+ boost.  But X_5 is (Gender * GPA).  The coefficent B_3 is -10.  So if GPA is maxed out at 4 then there is 35 - 40 for women which comes out to -5.  If it were a man the -40 would be zero.  Then the man would make more.  A convuluted answer but just do the math with a 100 IQ, 4.0 GPA for both a man and a woman.

3.b
IQ = 110
GPA = 4.0
50 + (20 * 4.0) + (0.07 * 110) + (35 * 1) + (0.01 * (4.0 * 110) ) + (-10 * (4.0 * 1) ) = 137.1

3.c
False
A large p-value would make this true.  

4.a
When fitting a model we are optimizing for training error.  So we would expect the polynominal function to have a lower training error with a more flexible model.

4.b
The polynomincal model would have more variance that neccesary so we would expect a worse performance from the polynominal on the testing data.

4.c
When fitting a model we are optimizing for training error.  So we would expect the polynominal function to have a lower training error with a more flexible model.

4.d
This is unknown because it would depend on how close to both models the true function is.

5
Do some simple algebra,

6.
B_0 = y_avg - B_1 * x_avg (pg. 62)

If y_avg is on the line at x_avg then the residual at that point will be zero.

B_0 + B_1 * x_avg
= y_avg - B_1 * x_avg +  B_1 * x_avg
= y_avg

y_avg - y_avg is 0 so the residual is zero and that means it is exactly on the line.



Better wording in many cases:
